# Aether Paper Minecraft Plugins

This project was created out of witnessing existing plugins'
codebase. Many commonly used plugins are created with the Minecraft 1.13 API,
which was released late 2017; and have not gone under any major development
to upgrade to a newer version, instead opting to create workarounds.

The plugins in this project aim to stay up-to-date with the latest major Minecraft API 
version.

See the `README.md` file in the various modules to learn more.
