# Aether Essentials

_Inspired by EssentialsX_

EssentialsX has been a community standard in plugin choice for its features. Most players are accustomed to commands
such as `/tpa`, `/home`, and `/back`
to name a few.

Overtime, it has become apparent in EssentialsX that some commands and permissions are unstable. This plugin seeks to
provide as much of the same functionality as EssentialsX as possible; there may be some additions and or subtractions
though.

The EssentialsX website can be found at [this link](https://essentialsx.net/).

Much of this plugin is based upon the same goals as EssentialsX, but this code is original and not derived from the
EssentialsX projects.
